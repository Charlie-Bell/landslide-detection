<h2><center>Landslide Prediction Challenge</h2></center>

A landslide is the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth(soil) down a slope. As a common natural hazard, it can lead to significant losses of human lives and properties.


Hong Kong, one of the hilly and densely populated cities in the world, is frequently affected by extreme rainstorms, making it highly susceptible to rain-induced natural terrain landslides

The common practice of identifying landslides is visual interpretation which, however, is labor-intensive and time-consuming.

***Thus, this hack focuses on automating the landslide identification process using artificial intelligence techniques***

This is achieved by using high-resolution terrain information to perform the terrain-based landslide identification. Other auxiliary data such as the lithology of the surface materials and rainfall intensification factor are also provided.

A total of 3 notebooks were created for this project:
1. 1_Landslide_prediction_CNN uses a CNN approach to the problem.
2. 2_Landslide_prediction_Boosting uses a boosting and stacking approach to the problem.
3. 3_Landslide_prediction_Combination takes the predictions from the above networks and uses them as features in the a fully connected NN.
